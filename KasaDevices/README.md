# (DEPRECATED) Hubitat Kasa Device Integration
This integration is now DEPRECATED in favor of the Built-In Capability and the HUBITAT Matter implementation. The integration still works; however, updates and fixes are not a priority on my part.

Legacy Kasa Devices. These are the non-Matter Kasa Devices except for the Kasa Hub 100. New installations should be via the built-in integration.

Matter Kasa Devices and Kasa Hub. Two options:

    Use the HUBITAT MATTER INTEGRATION.
    Go to the TP-Link TAPO integration below and select Kasa devices from the app.
        '[RELEASE] TP-LINK TAPO Plug, Switch, Bulb, and Hub Integration'

## This integration supports Kasa Matter Devices and the Kasa HUB.
